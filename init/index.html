I'm entering my apostate era. I'm syndicate maxing. 
I'm in my lane and striving I think to myself as I write this and headbob to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz04moVKyHY">Dandadan's opening theme</a>.
<br>
<br>
You may be wondering. Tim?
Why is this webpage so plain?
Because it needs to be.
Why is your writing style so cringe?
Because I'm learning.
<br>
<br>
The point here isn't to impress or persuade.
It's to document and disseminate.
<br>
<br>
I'll touch things up and learn some CSS like my more technically talented classmates on myspace back in middle school.
Like a new home this place is going to feel more homey as I unpack my things.

Tata for now
