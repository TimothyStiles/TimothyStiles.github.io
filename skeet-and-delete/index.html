            If there ever was a time to skeet with reckless abandon then it would be now.

            After watching various media giants destroy their media archives for tax gains and learning that all of my myspace data was deleted back in 2016 I'm convinced that nothing on the internet is permanent unless it is.

            Maybe you fear your intrusive thoughts but maybe it's better to just skeet and delete if things go sideways. 
            In order for this bsky to win it needs to thrive and that means it needs skeets of all sorts and that includes the large number of followers I have with 0 posts.

            Some of you who take this advice are probably not going to make it, but bsky will be better for it.

            Skeets for the skeet god are what keep the skeet god alive.
