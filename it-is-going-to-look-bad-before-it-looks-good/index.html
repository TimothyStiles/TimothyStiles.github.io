<h1>it's going to look bad before it looks good</h1>

<h6>12-2-2024</h6>

I have a <em>perfectionism</em> <b>problem</b>. Everything must be <em>perfect</em>. 
<br><br>
Somehow I know both exactly what is perfect while also having no clue what is perfect but I'll know it when I see it unless I don't.
<br><br>
I like <span style="color: #f38f1c; background-color: #000000;">warm</span> colors and I just learned how to use &ltp> &ltdiv> and &ltspan> tags effectively.

Maybe.



<p>I'm kind of treating this as a notebook repl for css which is cool</p>

<p>
    <span style="color:orange; background-color: cyan;">
        <b>THIS TEXT IS ORANGE WITH A CYAN BACKGROUND</b>
    </span>
</p>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: orangered;">
^^ hot dang that an easy solution to the "inline element takeover issue" <- this line isn't
</p>

<div>
    <h2>let's get my face in here:</h2>
<img style="border:5px solid #000000; padding:3px; margin:5px" src="/it-is-going-to-look-bad-before-it-looks-good/gritty-smash-the-racists.jpg" alt="Gritty the mascot with absolute chaotic energy with the subtitles, 'Don't talk to racists. Burn their flags, slash their tires, overwhelm their marches, smash them where they try to congregate.'">
</div>

<p>
    This isn't my best work
</p>

    it's going to look bad before it look's good
